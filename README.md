<!------------------------- Web UI ------------------------->

Nezuko has a built in web UI / API server for remotely running commands. For API enabled commands you can add them as buttons on the Web UI send HTTP POST requests from your favorite applications. I personally use HTTP Request Shortcuts on my Galaxy. It has a nice UI with support for custom icons, etc.

<!------------------------- GETTING STARTED ------------------------->

<h2 align="center"><b>Prerequisites</b></h2>

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

1. Clone Nezuko

```sh
git clone https://github.com/callmekory/nezuko.git
```

2. Install Yarn

Ubuntu / Debain

```sh
curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -

echo deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list

sudo apt install yarn
```

Arch Linux

```sh
sudo pacman -S yarn
```

3. Install packages

```sh
> yarn install
```

<h2 align="center"><b>Setup</b></h2>

1. Setup Bot Token and Prefix

> Navigate to /nezuko/data and rename `config.js.sample` to `config.js`. Open the file and edit as needed.

2. Setup Command Configs

> All commands and other settings are setup after the bot is added to your server. Either by running `config get` which will list all the settings you can edit and how to edit them or by navigating to `http://botIP:5700` and setting up your details there. Everything is saved to the database at `/nezuko/data/db.sqlite`.

If you would like to run Nezuko as a Docker container you'll need to build the image yourself.

1. Clone the repo to a folder of choice
2. CD into the folder and inside the folder `data` rename `config.js.sample` to `config.js` and enter your discord user ID and your bot token.
3. Navigate back into the main directory and run `docker build -t nezuko .`
4. After the build is finished you can run Nezuko with `docker run -p 570:5700 --name nezuko nezuko`. If you'd rather use Docker-Compose as I do then you can use the following sample config. Simply save it as `docker-compose.yml` and run `docker-compose up -d` to start her up. The webUI will be available at `http://BOTIP:5700`.

```json
version: '3'
services:
  nezukoBot:
    image: callmekory/nezuko
    container_name: nezuko
    volumes:
      - ./config:/app/build/config
    ports:
      - 5700:5700
    network_mode: bridge
    restart: unless-stopped

```
