<!------------------------- Web UI ------------------------->

Nezuko has a built in web UI / API server for remotely running commands and settings configs. For API enabled commands you can add them as buttons on the Web UI send HTTP POST requests from your favorite applications. I personally use HTTP Request Shortcuts on my Galaxy. It has a nice UI with support for custom icons, etc.

<!------------------------- GETTING STARTED ------------------------->

<h2 align="center"><b>Prerequisites</b></h2>

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

1. Clone Nezuko

```sh
git clone https://github.com/callmekory/nezuko.git
```

2. Install Yarn

Ubuntu / Debain

```sh
curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -

echo deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list

sudo apt install yarn
```

Arch Linux

```sh
sudo pacman -S yarn
```

3. Install packages

```sh
> yarn install
```

<h2 align="center"><b>Setup</b></h2>

1. Setup Bot Token and Prefix

> Navigate to /nezuko/data and rename `config.js.sample` to `config.js`. Open the file and edit as needed.

2. Setup Command Configs

> All commands and other settings are setup after the bot is added to your server. Either by running `config get` which will list all the settings you can edit and how to edit them or by navigating to `http://botIP:5700` and setting up your details there. Everything is saved to the database at `/nezuko/data/db.sqlite`.

If you would like to run Nezuko as a Docker container you'll need to build the image yourself.

1. Clone the repo to a folder of choice
2. CD into the folder and inside the folder `data` rename `config.js.sample` to `config.js` and enter your discord user ID and your bot token.
3. Navigate back into the main directory and run `docker build -t nezuko .`
4. After the build is finished you can run Nezuko with `docker run -p 570:5700 --name nezuko nezuko`. If you'd rather use Docker-Compose as I do then you can use the following sample config. Simply save it as `docker-compose.yml` and run `docker-compose up -d` to start her up. The webUI will be available at `http://BOTIP:5700`.

```json
version: '3'
services:
  nezukoBot:
    image: callmekory/nezuko
    container_name: nezuko
    volumes:
      - ./config:/app/build/config
    ports:
      - 5700:5700
    network_mode: bridge
    restart: unless-stopped

```
